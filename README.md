[00:11.78] 君は風邪をひいた時のような声で
[00:17.78] 僕の名前を何度も呼びました
[00:23.86] あなたから僕への愛のサインは
[00:30.01] それはそれは 奥ゆかしく泣けました
[00:38.51] 
[00:48.13] 君が僕の左腕を噛み付いた
[00:54.75] 食いちぎってくれたって別によかったのに
[01:00.96] 今も紅く紫の跡を遺して
[01:06.89] これが消えるまでが僕の寿命みたいな
[01:12.49] 気がしたんだ 気がしたんだ 気がしたんだ Ah Ah Ah...
[01:28.49] 
[01:37.80] 君が読み上げる自分の醜さは
[01:43.89] 僕にはただただ美しくしかなくて
[01:50.07] 厭なとこと言えば 抜け落ちる記憶と
[01:56.15] いつまでも抜け落ちない誰かの足跡
[02:04.15] 
[02:01.69] She was a little monster
[02:04.39] Was born in an end of Eastern
[02:07.44] On her back there's an awkward feather
[02:10.31] That's big enough to carry one whole planet
[02:14.37] Now little monster
[02:16.40] Oh girl, should I name you Easter?
[02:19.57] I'm here to celebrate you
[02:22.10] For being in time when we are awake
[02:39.60] 
[02:42.14] 右利きのハサミを左手で無理に
[02:48.31] 切り続けるような僕らの愛しい日々
[02:54.51] 横で子供でも見てたら喚き出すだろう もう
[03:00.70] それはそれは不器用で泣けました
[03:08.20] 
[03:06.81] 僕のお腹に君の子が宿ったとしても Oh
[03:13.02] 何事もなくいびきをかき続けるだろう
[03:19.21] 相も変わらず昼下がりに眼を覚まし
[03:25.34] 大げさな愛で僕を丸めこむのでしょう
[03:33.84] 
[03:43.45] She was a little monster
[03:45.81] Was born in an end of Eastern
[03:48.92] On her back there's an awkward feather
[03:52.32] That's big enough to carry one whole planet
[03:56.05] Now little monster
[03:58.03] Oh girl should, I name you Easter?
[04:01.06] I'm here to celebrate you
[04:04.60] For being in time when we are awake
[04:22.10] 
[04:21.90] She was a little monster
[04:24.56] Was born in an end of Eastern
[04:27.08] On her back there's an awkward feather
[04:30.40] That's big enough to carry one whole planet
[04:34.75] Now little monster
[04:36.44] Oh girl should, I name you Easter?
[04:39.65] I'm here to celebrate you
[04:43.04] For being in time when we are awake
